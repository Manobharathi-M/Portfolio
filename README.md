A clean and responsive personal portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills, projects, and contact details in a structured and professional layout. Each section is placed on a separate page for smooth navigation and a real-world developer portfolio feel.

Key Sections

Home: Intro, tagline, and quick navigation.
About: My skills, tools, and what I can build.
Projects: Shows my main works with images, tech stack, and detailed popups (Senthuron Café, Eco-friendly Goods, Weather App).
Contact: Simple contact form with success message and stored messages using localStorage.

Goal

To present my work professionally, make it easy for people to learn about me, and offer a clean UI that works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
